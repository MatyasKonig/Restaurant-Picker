# Restaurant-Picker

## View the video!
The way this tiny program works is described in detail in a video I made about Python for Beginners. You can watch the video on YouTube [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mAmZIRfJBs) (there are no ads on this video)

## Important
This program does not handle any errors. Because of that, if a user tries to remove a restaurant from the list and the restaurant does not exist, an error will occur.

## Purpose
While this program is simple, it might be useful for folks who are just starting out with programming to see how to write a program without any complex techniques.

## Language and software used
- Python 3
- Anaconda
- Spyder
